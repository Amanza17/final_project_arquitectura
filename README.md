Final project for the 'Arquitectura Software para Robots' subject (2024–2025).  
Built on **ROS 2 Jazzy**, this system allows a robot to detect a nearby person, initiate a dialogue, and autonomously guide them to the position where their chosen degree is taught using navigation and behavior trees.

---

## 🧠 What does this project do?

- Detects people nearby using an **ELP stereo camera** and 3D point cloud processing.
- Uses **YOLO (v8)** to detect people in the image.
- Projects the 2D detection into a **3D point cloud** to estimate real-world distance.
- When a person approaches the "base" (less than 1 meter to the camera), the robot **starts a dialogue** to ask which degree program they are interested in.
- A **Kobuki robot** with **Nav2** autonomously navigates to the corresponding classroom or position, wait a few seconds, and returns to the base.
- A **Behavior Tree** orchestrates the flow of the main computer (the one with the camera): Detection, dialogue and communication.
- A **FSM** orchestrates the behaviour of the Kobuki Robot: Communication and autonomous navigation.
