# elp_stereo_camera

ROS2 camera driver for the ELP stereo camera, tested with ROS Jazzy and the ELP-USB3D1080P120-H120 model.
The node reads out the camera images at highest fps to minimize motion blur of the camera. The images are published at specified fps to the ROS system.

The supported formats of the camera can be found in `/config/supported_formats.txt`.  
To create disparity images and/or point clouds, you need to calibrate the camera and adjust the camera parameter files in `/cam_params`.

## USAGE

### Start the Camera
```bash
ros2 launch elp_stereo_camera stereo_camera_launch.py
```


### Camera Calibration (example)
```bash
ros2 run camera_calibration cameracalibrator --size 10x7 --square 0.025 right:=/stereo/right/image_raw left:=/stereo/left/image_raw right_camera:=/stereo/right left_camera:=/stereo/left
```

### Stereo Image Processing (rectification, disparity image and point cloud):
```bash
ros2 launch stereo_image_proc stereo_image_proc.launch.py namespace:=stereo
```# elp_stereocam_3d_rps2
